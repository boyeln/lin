//! Common types shared across domain models.
//!
//! This module contains shared types like pagination helpers and enums
//! that are used by multiple domain-specific modules.

// Currently no shared types needed - PageInfo and similar pagination types
// are not yet used in this codebase. This module is reserved for future use.
